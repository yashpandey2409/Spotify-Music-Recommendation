# Music Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid music recommendation system that provides song recommendations based on a combination of content-based filtering and popularity scores. The goal is to enhance the recommendation quality by taking into account both the similarity of the content and the popularity of the tracks.

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Uses features of the songs to recommend similar tracks.
- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Incorporates the popularity of the songs to improve the recommendation list.
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines content-based and popularity-based approaches to provide more balanced recommendations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Any other dependencies required by your `content_based_recommendations` and `calculate_weighted_popularity` functions.
